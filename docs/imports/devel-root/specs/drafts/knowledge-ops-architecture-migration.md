# Knowledge Ops — Architecture Audit & Migration Spec

> *Kill Ragussy. Promote OpenPlanner. Make services thin. Package the runtime.*

---

## The Problem

Services contain source code. That's wrong.

```
BEFORE (broken):

services/openplanner/    ← source code lives here
services/ragussy/        ← source code lives here  
services/kms-ingestion/  ← source code lives here
services/futuresight-kms/ ← compose + nginx + vendored code

packages/openplanner-*   ← JS client wrapper
packages/futuresight-kms/ ← Python + TypeScript source code
orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/     ← TypeScript source code
```

Everything is backwards. The runtime should be a **package**. The service should be a **compose config** that says "run this package with these env vars."

And more importantly:

This is **not** a client-demo architecture.

This is a system intended to be useful to the workspace owner first:
- managing `devel`
- querying code, docs, configs, and live events
- reviewing dependency structure
- operating truth/control-plane workbenches
- producing publishable content from the same corpus

Clients are a downstream use case of a system that must already be useful in-house.

| Leads enrichment | `orgs/mojomast/ragussy/backend/app/api/main.py` | RDAP + ISP + cloud provider | Working (built this session) |
| Leads UI | `orgs/mojomast/ragussy/frontend/src/pages/Leads.tsx` | Enrichment stats, host table | Working (built this session) |
| QueryPage | `orgs/mojomast/ragussy/frontend/src/pages/QueryPage.tsx` | Federated search + synthesis | Working (built this session) |
| Chat Lab fix | `orgs/mojomast/ragussy/backend/app/api/ragussy.py` | Health URL | Fixed this session |
| OpenPlanner | `services/openplanner/` | Event lake, search, embeddings, job queue, auth | Working |
| Cephalon TS | `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/` | Agent framework, memory, OpenPlanner client | Working |

| Our-gpus | `orgs/shuv/our-gpus/` + `services/our-gpus/` | Ollama discovery, leads | Working, 10K+ hosts |
| Portal | `services/portal/` | Dashboard with links | Working |

### Ragussy — what it is

| Component | What | Should keep? |
|-----------|------|:---:|
| `ragussy/backend/app/api/rag.py` | RAG ingest/search (Qdrant) | No — OpenPlanner replaces |
| `ragussy/backend/app/api/openai.py` | OpenAI-compat chat (llama.cpp) | No — Proxx replaces |
| `ragussy/backend/app/api/proxx.py` | Proxy to Proxx | No — talk to Proxx directly |
| `ragussy/backend/app/api/shibboleth.py` | Handoff to Shibboleth | Move to km_labels |
| `ragussy/backend/app/services/embeddings_service.py` | BGE-M3 embeddings | Reference only |
| `ragussy/frontend/src/pages/*` | React pages (ChatLab, CMS, Ingestion, Query) | Keep as UI components |
| `ragussy/frontend/src/lib/api.ts` | API client | Migrate to km_labels |
| `ragussy/backend/app/api/server.py` | llama.cpp lifecycle | Keep for local model serving only |

### What to kill

| Component | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Ragussy as the central backend | It's a thin proxy over Qdrant + llama.cpp + Proxx. OpenPlanner replaces Qdrant. Proxx replaces llama.cpp. The proxy layer adds nothing. |
| `services/openplanner/` as source code | Should be a package. Service should be compose config. |
| `services/futuresight-kms/kms-ingestion/` as source code | Should be a package. Service should be compose config. |
| `packages/futuresight-kms/python/` as the primary backend | Split: document management goes to OpenPlanner, labeling stays, export stays |

## What OpenPlanner Becomes

OpenPlanner stops being "the event lake" and becomes **the entire product runtime**:

### Current (events only)

- `POST /v1/events` — ingest events
- `POST /v1/search/fts` — full-text search
- `POST /v1/search/vector` — vector search
- `GET /v1/events/:id` — get event
- Jobs API — import/export
- Blob API — binary storage

### Extended (documents + CMS + gardens)

| New endpoint | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `POST /v1/documents` | Ingest a document (chunk + embed + store) |
| `GET /v1/documents` | List documents with visibility filter |
| `GET /v1/documents/:id` | Get document |
| `PATCH /v1/documents/:id` | Update document content or visibility |
| `POST /v1/documents/:id/publish` | Set visibility=public |
| `POST /v1/documents/:id/archive` | Set visibility=archived |
| `POST /v1/query/search` | Federated search across lakes |
| `POST /v1/query/answer` | Search + synthesize through Proxx |
| `GET /v1/gardens` | List available workbench views |
| `GET /v1/gardens/:id` | Get one garden definition |

### Data model

Documents are events with `kind: "docs" | "code" | "config" | "data"`.
Visibility is metadata: `meta.visibility: "internal" | "review" | "public" | "archived"`.
Gardens are named projections and operator views over the same store.

One runtime. One canonical store. No separate CMS knowledge base.

### Gardens

Not every useful surface is a chat.

OpenPlanner should expose named workbench views called **gardens**. A garden is:
- a saved projection over one or more lakes
- a dedicated operator surface
- optionally visual, tabular, graph-based, or truth-oriented

Known devel gardens:

| Garden | Existing implementation | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------------|---------|
| `devel-deps-garden` | `services/devel-deps-garden/` | dependency graph review for the workspace |
| `truth-workbench` | `services/eta-mu-truth-workbench/` | truth-resolution and control-plane view |
| `query` | current `kms-query` surface | federated text retrieval and synthesis |
| `ingestion` | current `kms-ingestion` surface | file/system intake and routing |

The product is not just “CMS + chat.” It is a **gardened workbench system** over a shared runtime.

---

## What Cephalon Becomes

Cephalon becomes the AI engine. It talks to OpenPlanner for data and Proxx for inference.

```
Cephalon TS:
  ├── memory/           ← OpenPlanner client (already exists)
  ├── inference/        ← Proxx client (NEW)
  ├── cognition/        ← reasoning, planning (existing)
  └── tools/            ← file read, shell, MCP (existing)

Cephalon is the "brain" that:
  1. Searches OpenPlanner for context
  2. Sends context + question to Proxx
  3. Returns grounded answers
  4. Manages conversation memory in OpenPlanner
```

Cephalon already has the OpenPlanner client (`orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/openplanner/client.ts`). It needs a Proxx client and a query engine that combines search + synthesis.

Cephalon is what powers:
- collection-aware chat
- grounded synthesis
- garden-specific operators
- multi-lake reasoning

## What Gets Killed

| Component | Replaced by |
|-----------|-------------|
| Ragussy `/api/rag/search` | OpenPlanner `/v1/search/*` |
| Ragussy `/api/rag/ingest/text` | OpenPlanner `/v1/documents` |
| Ragussy `/api/proxx/chat` | Cephalon → Proxx directly |
| Ragussy `/v1/chat/completions` | Proxx directly |
| Ragussy llama.cpp lifecycle | Local model serving only (optional) |
| km_labels `documents` table | OpenPlanner events with visibility metadata |
| km_labels CMS router | OpenPlanner document endpoints |
| `services/futuresight-kms/kms-ingestion/` | OpenPlanner document ingestion |

---

## What Stays (km_labels, trimmed)

km_labels keeps:
- `tenants` table + router
- `km_labels` table + router (label CRUD)
- `export` router (SFT/RLHF)
- `health` router

km_labels loses:
- `cms` router (moves to OpenPlanner)
- `ingestion` router (moves to OpenPlanner)

km_labels becomes a thin labeling service that talks to OpenPlanner for document access and Proxx/Cephalon for inference.

---

## Roadmap

- Add `POST /v1/documents/:id/publish` — set public
- Add `POST /v1/documents/:id/archive` — set archived

### Phase 2: Cephalon query engine (week 2-3)

- Add Proxx client to cephalon-ts
- Add `search + synthesize` function
- Add federated search across lakes
