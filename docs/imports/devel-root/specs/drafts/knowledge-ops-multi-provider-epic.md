# The Lake — Multi-Provider Epic

> *One platform. Four deployment targets. The provider is a configuration detail.*

---

## Purpose

Define the epic that delivers the multi-provider knowledge platform: abstract interfaces + domain logic + four provider implementations. The product is the integration layer and domain logic. The provider is selected at deploy time, not at build time.

---

## Why Multi-Provider

The platform is open source. You don't control where it gets deployed. The client chooses the cloud. Your job is to make it work on all of them.

| Client type | Provider | Why |
|-------------|----------|-----|
| Enterprise on Microsoft stack (FutureSight) | **Azure** | Already on Azure. Azure AI Search + OpenAI + Cosmos DB. |
| AWS-native startups | **AWS** | Bedrock + OpenSearch + DynamoDB. |
| Privacy-first / sovereignty | **Self-hosted** | MongoDB + mongot + Ollama. No cloud dependency. |
| Developers / demos / OSS contributors | **Local/Dev** | ChromaDB + DuckDB + Ollama. $0, runs anywhere. |

---

## Epic Structure

### Epic 0: Provider Abstraction Layer

Define the interfaces. This is the most important epic — everything else depends on it.

| Story | Points | Files |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 0.1 Define SearchProvider interface | 3 | `packages/knowledge-lake/src/core/interfaces.ts` |
| 0.2 Define EmbeddingProvider interface | 2 | same file |
| 0.3 Define StorageProvider interface | 2 | same file |
| 0.4 Define BlobProvider interface | 1 | same file |
| 0.5 Define QueueProvider interface | 1 | same file |
| 0.6 Define AuthProvider interface | 2 | same file |
| 0.7 Provider factory from env config | 3 | `packages/knowledge-lake/src/core/config.ts` |
| 0.8 Domain logic layer (provider-independent) | 8 | `packages/knowledge-lake/src/domain/` |

## Build Order

```
Epic 0 (Abstraction) ──────► Epic 1 (Local/Dev) ──► Ship demo
                                    │
                          ┌─────────┼─────────┐
                          ▼         ▼         ▼
                    Epic 2     Epic 3     Epic 4
                  (Self-host)  (Azure)    (AWS)
                          │         │         │
                          └─────────┼─────────┘
                                    ▼
                            Epic 5 (Tests)
```

1. **Epic 0 first** — interfaces define the contract. Everything else implements it.
2. **Epic 1 second** — local/dev is the fastest to build and test. Ship the demo here.
3. **Epic 2, 3, 4 in parallel** — once interfaces are stable, provider implementations can be built independently.
4. **Epic 5 last** — conformance tests verify cross-provider consistency.

## Total Effort

| Epic | Points | Relative Size |
|------|--------|---------------|
| 0. Abstraction | 22 | ~2 weeks |
| 1. Local/Dev | 23 | ~2 weeks |
| 2. Self-Hosted | 28 | ~2.5 weeks |
| 3. Azure | 32 | ~3 weeks |
| 4. AWS | 31 | ~3 weeks |
| 5. Tests | 26 | ~2 weeks |
| **Total** | **162** | **~14-16 weeks (sequential)** |

With parallelization (Epics 2/3/4 built simultaneously after Epic 1):
**~8-10 weeks with 2-3 people, or ~12-14 weeks solo.**

## The Open Source Pitch

"The knowledge platform runs on your cloud. Azure, AWS, your own servers, or a developer laptop. Same code, different provider config. No vendor lock-in. No proprietary runtime. The only thing we sell is the expertise to deploy and maintain it."
