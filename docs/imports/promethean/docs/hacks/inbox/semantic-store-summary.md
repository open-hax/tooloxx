### Key APIs

```typescript
// Basic usage (identical to DualStoreManager)
const store = await SemanticStore.create('name', 'text', 'createdAt');
await store.insert({ text: 'content', metadata: {} });
const results = await store.getMostRelevant(['query'], 10);

// Advanced configuration
const store = await SemanticStoreFactory.create('name', 'text', 'createdAt', {
  primaryDriver: 'postgresql',
  vectorDriver: 'pinecone',
  consistency: 'strict',
});
```
