# Package Generator

This Nx generator scaffolds new Promethean packages under `packages/<name>`.

## Options

- `name` (string, required): Kebab-case identifier for the package. The generator
  normalizes the value using Nx `names()` so `My Library` becomes `my-library`.
- `preset` (string, default: `ts-lib`): Template preset to use. The available
  presets are listed below.

## Presets

### `ts-lib`

Creates a TypeScript library aligned with `@promethean-os/utils`. The preset
includes:

- Shared config (`ava.config.mjs`, `project.json`, `tsconfig.json`).
- Documentation boilerplate (`README.md`).
- Licensing (`LICENSE.txt`).
- Sample source and test files (`src/index.ts`, `src/tests/sample.test.ts`).

## Usage

```bash
pnpm nx g ./tools/generators/package --name awesome-lib --preset ts-lib
```

Use `--dry-run` to preview the generated files without writing to disk.

## Follow-up task for operators

Review the generated README and extend it with package-specific usage notes once
real functionality has been implemented.
The package generator scaffolds new workspace packages. Pass a `preset` when you
want opinionated layouts:

```bash
pnpm nx g ./tools/generators/package --name my-service --preset fastify-service
```

## `fastify-service` preset

The `fastify-service` preset wires up a Fastify service with health and
diagnostics endpoints, static asset mounts, and Swagger plumbing. The template
expects the following environment knobs at runtime:

- `SERVICE_PORT` (preferred) or `PORT` defines the listen port. The first valid
  integer wins, otherwise the server falls back to `4500`.
- `SERVICE_STATIC_DIRS` augments static mounts. Provide a colon-separated list of
  `prefix=directory` pairs. Relative directories resolve from the generated
  package root. Directories that do not exist are ignored.

By default the service exposes:

- `/health` and `/diagnostics` backed by `@promethean-os/web-utils`.
- Static assets from `dist/frontend` at `/<service-name>/` and from `static/` at
  `/<service-name>/static/`.
- `/docs` serving Swagger UI and `/openapi.json` exposing the OpenAPI document.

### Defining Swagger schemas

Routes should declare Fastify `schema` objects for request and response shapes.
`@fastify/swagger` reads those schemas to materialize `/openapi.json`. Populate
`schema.operationId`, `schema.tags`, and the `schema.response` map on each route
so the generated document stays accurate. The template seeds an empty
`components.schemas` object—extend it with shared schema definitions as you add
endpoints.

## Follow-up work for humans

- [ ] Configure CI to exercise generated services (build + tests) so new
      scaffolds stay green.
